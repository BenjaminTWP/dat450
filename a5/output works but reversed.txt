* [SIM=0.551042] Programmed cell death (PCD) is the regulated death of cells within an organism. The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from [{'id': 21645374}]

In our study, we suggest that glomerular hyperfiltration due to pregnancy does not have adverse effects on kidney in women with more parities. Pregnancy may have possible

We aimed to investigate the glomerular hyperfiltration due to pregnancy in women with more parities. Five hundred women aged 52.57 +/- 8.08 years, without a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus or complicated pregnancy were involved in the study. They were divided into three groups. Group 1: women with no or one parity (n = 76); group 2: women with two or three parities (n = 333); group 3:

parity (n = 76); group 2: women with two or three parities (n = 333); group 3: women with four or more parities (n = 91). Laboratory parameters and demographical data were compared between the three groups. Mean age, serum urea and serum creatinine were similar between three groups. Patients in group 3 had significantly higher GFR values compared to groups 1 and 2 (109.44 +/- 30.99, 110.76 +/-
